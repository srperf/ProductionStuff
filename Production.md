# Leandro's video production tips
Here is a quick guide on recommendations, gear I use, recommend and other details.
Please feel free to ask if you have questions.

## Video matters
There are some super important things to video IMO.
#### Good lenses
I start talking about lenses and not cameras, since unless you have other specific means, most cameras will give you outstanding image if you use the adequate lens.
The first decision I take on a lens is the space that I will have between me (or the subject) and the camera. Many have small spaces, offices and studios. For those I recommend small focal distance.
Usually 15 to 20 milimeters are great for small spaces. If you have larger spaces, you can play with 20 to 30mm, but beyond 30 I only recommend for outside or huge studios.
Second is to have great aperture. This is marked with an F and a number and is inversely proportional. Smaller number, greater apperture. I usually recommend getting lenses with f2.0 or less.
That reduces the need of too much lighting, and gives a nice depth of field (bokeh) effect.
WARNING: If you are a one person studio, avoid manual focus lenses.

Lenses I like:
This depends on the camera you have, but most of these have equivalents.
- Sigma 16mm f1.4
- Sigma 30mm f1.4
- Tamron 17-70mm f2.8 (A bit less than the apperture I like but great to have zoom!)

### Great lighting
This is the other element to have superb videos.
I like to have 2 point or even 3 point lighting.

But a key here is to have large, difused and strong lights.
AVOID small - non difused light sources like just lightbulbs. They create awful shadows on your face and surfaces.

For desk, use a large-ish light. If you can, have two, or one with a white bounce surface. You can bounce lights :D

I recommend Elgato Key Light. Even better if you can have two. I know they are pricey, but a great investment.
If you have a window and light nearby, you could avoid the second one. Or even better get a bounce board.
CHEAP OPTION: Get a smart lightbulb and place a difuser on top of it.

Elsewhere if you have more space, I recommend having a couple of Neewer led lights. There is a nice kit in Amazon: NEEWER 2 Pieces Bi-color 660 LED Video Light and Stand Kit Includes 

Now for travel, super practical, bring a couple of portable travel lights like SmallRig RM120 5000mAh. They are very useful and last for some hours.


### Camera needs

Here it depends on your needs. If you are just gonna be using it as a webcam, if you want to record offline, if you want portable, usb chargeable, etc, there are many choices.

Currently I use two cameras:
- Canon M50 Mark 2: 
Cheapest option with great quality. 
Works as a webcam with USB, has clean hdmi output, doesn't heat or over heat at all, and overall I think it is balanced.
Light and great for holding it and Vlog holding it on your hand and sweet auto focus.
The biggest con is that if you want to record offline, the camera limits you to 30 minute blocks. It also turns off automatically after a while.


- BlackMagic Pocket Cinema Studio
This is for movie style stuff. Do not recommend it for most and has to be used static. It is for movies or a studio.
No image stabilization or dynamic auto focus. Again is for manual setings or constant manual drive, even with outo foucs efforts.
Bright side, Works great with ATEM switchers and their software.

I am thinking on moving towards Sony now. They seem to have lots of advantages like not limiting recording time, USB charging, and clean hdmi. But I know they get hot ... Definetly gotta play a bit with them.

## Audio Matters
Audio is even more important than video.
But I will keep working on this as this is it for now. WIP
